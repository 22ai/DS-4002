## A Little Bit About the Course
The objective of this course is for students to gain experience working on data-driven 
problems while developing the ability to critique their own work and the work of others 
productively. The key element that separates this course from traditional courses is that it 
is driven by student-led projects. Students will be asked to set the expectations for the 
course, contribute to its tactical objectives, and provide critical feedback to peers. Aside 
from providing datasets and infrastructure support, setting high-level project goals, and 
offering mentorship and technical guidance, the instructor and TA will serve primarily in 
advisory capacities for the student teams.
The class meets in-person; attendance is compulsory. If circumstances arise that preclude 
attendance at a particular session, students are to notify group members and the instructor 
as soon as possible so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged (for example a 
death in the family). Group work outside of class is expected. Students will be assigned to 
small groups to work together on three projects throughout the semester. Groups will be 
assigned after the first two weeks of class (aka the fundamental training period, aka by 
Feb 7)


## What you’ll learn along the way
Data Science is a broad, elusive, and dynamic field best learned via hands-on experience. 
Topics in this course are selected to reinforce this perspective and help students understand 
the field’s core ideas and what is demanded from practicing data scientists. An ideal 
outcome would be for students to gain a perspective on the breadth of the field of data 
science, understand important tools and environments, and develop skills necessary to 
contribute to the community. Learning objectives include:
* • Cognitive
  *o research ideas in a domain and create a testable hypothesis/model
  *o develop a project plan based on the scientific method principles
  *o establish data sets relevant to your hypothesis/model
  *o create a functioning data science pipeline
  *o prepare findings for presentation to your peers
*• Social
  *o Collaborate with peers to implement your project plan
  * Provide constructive criticism
  *o Demonstrate appropriate behavior in group settings
*• Psychomotor
  *o Present results of a team project and field audience questions


## How You’ll Know You Are Learning (Assessments)
Every assignment in this class falls into one of 5 categories outlined below. Each assignment has a rubric to indicate the purpose, task, and criteria for the assignment.

The 5 assignment categories:
1. Labs - there is a lab section for this course and every student is expected to enroll and complete the lab assignments. The definintion of "lab" is loose as the assignments performed in the lab sections vary. The goal is for all of this work to be completable within the class lab period.
2. "Read" and Review - every week supplemental material will be posted to enhance the in class activities. This is not just reading but can also include watching short videos. A short review of the key points is then submitted as the assignment deliverable.
3. Case Study Extensions - During the semesters case studies will be presented. This assignment type involves going beyond the initial parameter of the case study and exploring some of the more advanced points.
4. "Look ahead" - These assignments are designed to allow students to advance their mastery of topics further. The incorperate material from course typically taken by 2nd and 3rd year students.
5. Final Essay - This assignment is the students opportunity to synthesize the semester and show mastery of the primary learning objective "define data science". The higher bundles require a more complex essay which includes a discussion of personal career paths in data science and ultimately discussing next steps and the future of data science.

## Tech Stack (Course Delivery Tools)

## A few Policies that will Govern the Class

Grading Policies: This course uses the specifications grading system as explained in **Specifications Grading** By Linda Nilson. For details [see this page](grading.md).

University of Virginia Honor System: All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. The instructor will indicate which assignments and activities are to be done individually and which permit collaboration. The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.


Special Needs:  The University of Virginia accommodates students with disabilities. Any SCPS student with a disability who needs accommodation (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, just follow up with me concerning any logistics and implementation of accommodations.  Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the SDAC: 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-5188/Fax.
